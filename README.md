## Intro
This is an application that I created to convert images to monospace pixel strings for Space Engineers.

If you modify this, please credit me :) 

This is my first windows app, and I spent a lot of time on this. I hope y'all enjoy!

## Description
This code utilizes a variety of dithering methods to convert each pixel from  a 24 bit color into a 9 bit color.
By reducing the number of colors in an image, we can use the color pixels in the Monospace font in Space Engineers
to "draw" the image on a text panel without the need for mods.

## How to use
1. Browse for your desired image file.

1. Select surface type and name.

1. Select dithering option

1. Click "Convert and Copy to Clipboard"

1. Copy and paste all the text from you clip board into your in-game LCD screen

1. Set the "Content" to "Text and Images"

1. Set font size to 0.1 (minimum), text padding to 0, and the font MONOSPACED
